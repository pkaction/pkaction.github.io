<p class="message">
  Welcome to my humble blog.  These are just the opinions of an old gamer.  
</p>

I have been playing computer games for over 25 years, and I've seen games evolve from monochrome text adventures to immersive multiplayer persistent worlds.  I've had great times with the games I've played, and like most gamers, I've had a lot of thoughts about how to improve those games.  

I strongly believe that whatever you do, you should not be a pure consumer.  People should be biased to create, and contribute something new to the world.  I started this site to share my thoughts, in the hope that they may spark some discussions.  

If some of the ideas reach the game designers or developers, I hope they would see this as my humble contribution to the games that have brought me so much enjoyment over the years.


The games I'm playing right now:

* [Dota 2](http://dota2.com)


Thanks for reading.  If you have questions or suggestions, please write to pk at pkaction.
